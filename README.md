A prototype mod for minetest that uses entities to create cloth/armor/whatever. 

The most of the code is taken from builtin/player.lua. I only edited it to register a test entity and to synchronize animation with player's.

Still think that multiple models are better, as then we would be able to have armors from different sets simultaneously.
